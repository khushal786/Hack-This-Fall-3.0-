# Hack This Fall 3.0
# Project:- House Price Prediction System

The Official Submission of team **Sinister Bytes** for [Hack This fall 3.0](https://hackthisfall.tech/). The Problem statement for the project is based on Data Science.  The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Data Analysis and Data Visualization.

## Problem Statement

Following the constant downward rally of stocks in the stock market, a gradual shift has been seen in investing patterns of people towards the the Real Estate market. House Price prediction, is important to drive Real Estate efficiency. As earlier, House prices were determined by calculating the acquiring and selling price in a locality. Therefore, the House Price prediction model is very essential in filling the information gap and improve Real Estate efficiency. 
House prices increase every year, so there is a need for a system to predict house prices in the future. House price prediction can help the developer determine the selling price of a house and can help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a house. The price of a house are highly effected by various conditions like physical conditions, area, concept and location. With this model, we would be able to better predict the prices.
